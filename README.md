## This repository is kept for archival purposes!
- This project was initially created during my sophomore year along with my friends listed below.
- Also, I wouldn't recommend using this project as a basis for your own as it's chock-full of security vulnerabilities *(passwords were kept in plaintext, reaaally secure 2nd year me)*
- If you'd like an updated version using the Laravel 12 PHP framework, I'll update this repository to link to that new project *(it's a work-in-progress!)*.
